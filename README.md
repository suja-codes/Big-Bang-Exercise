### Description 

- This exercise generates two balls colored red and blue going in equal and opposite directions.

- This is made possible by setting different velocities (velx, vely & -velx, -vely) for both of them.
  
- factory(100) makes 100 balls moving to make patterns that look like bigbang - exploding and coming back together. 

### To Run this Program

In order to run this file, Fork and Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Drag and drop bigBang.html onto a browser tab

- Open console in developer tools.

- Set gravity = 0 to see a pattern of particles exploding and coming back together.

- Set factory(100) to create 100 particles.

- Call update() to see the particles in action.

- Not setting gravity to 0 still works but yields more like a jumping pattern not a bigbang pattern we are rooting for.
              
### Future RoadMap

This project can be still be enhanced by 

- making more random patterns.
